cv-builder-backend

Project overview
- Simple backend for a CV/resume builder application using Express, Mongoose and authentication.
- Uses an in-memory MongoDB (`mongodb-memory-server`) for development/testing by default.

Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- npm

Quick start
1. Install dependencies

   npm install

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root if you need to override defaults. Available environment variables (optional):
- `PORT` — port to run the server (default: `5000`)
- `JWT_SECRET` — secret used for signing JWTs (default in code: `'secret'`)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` — Google OAuth client ID (used for Google sign-in)

Note: The project uses an in-memory MongoDB for development (`mongodb-memory-server`). No `MONGO_URI` is required for local dev; data will not persist between runs.

Run the app
- Development (uses `nodemon`):

   npm run dev

- Production / start:

   npm start

Project structure (top-level)
- `server.js` — application entrypoint
- `config/` — configuration (DB, passport)
- `controllers/` — route handlers
- `routes/` — express routes
- `models/` — mongoose models (`User.js`, `CV.js`)
- `middleware/` — auth and validation middleware
- `utils/` — helpers (email, pdf)

API notes
- Authentication uses JWTs. Look for `authRoutes.js` and `authController.js` for endpoints such as register, login, and OAuth handlers.
- CV routes are under `cvRoutes.js` and managed by `cvController.js`.
- Payment-related routes are under `paymentRoutes.js`.

Testing & development tips
- Because MongoDB runs in-memory for dev, restart the server to reset the data.
- Add any cloud provider credentials (e.g., Cloudinary, email SMTP) to `.env` and update the relevant `utils/` files if you integrate them.

Next steps
- Add a `README.md` if you prefer markdown with badges and richer formatting.
- Add `.env.example` listing recommended env variables for contributors.

If you'd like, I can also:
- Create a `README.md` (markdown) version.
- Generate an `.env.example` file with suggested keys.
